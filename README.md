# FightingGame 
This is my first project outside of a school assignment, which is a simple fighting game between the player
and computer in java. The rules are in the menu of the game if you are curious.
I used Object Oriented Programming to create everything that would be needed to simulate a fighting game, and 
planned out how the interactions would work on a peice of paper before implementing them in code. It wasn't too
challenging to create the base version of this game, but I hope to complicate this game and update it as time goes 
on. Adding more variety in moves, the ability to play against someone sitting next to you, adding varried dialouge
to the announcer and so forth. I coded this in intelliJ and as such the code for the actual game is in 
/FightingGame/src. Thank you for checking out my first project!
